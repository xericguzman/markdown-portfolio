# Markdown Portfolio

In this assignment, you'll create a simple web page built with Markdown that displays information about yourself.

If you ever have any questions about Markdown syntax, feel free to reference the documentation here: https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet

### Instructions

1. Start by forking this repository
1. In your "fork" of the repository, edit the `README.md` and replace all of the previous content with your own Markdown which should contain:
    * A title (your name)
    * At least one picture
    * At least one link (this could be to your GitHub page, your LinkedIn, or whatever you want)
    * At least one bullet point list
    * At least one numbered list
1. Once you've added all of the previous elements, read through this markdown cheatsheet (https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) and add one additional element not previously listed
1. Once you're done with this, adjust the settings of your repoistory to enable GitHub Pages. This should provide you a URL at which your project is hosted.
2. Update the "About" section of your repository so that your project's "website" is the GitHub Pages URL
3. Finally, turn in a link to your repository on Populi
